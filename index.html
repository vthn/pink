      <h1>United in <em>pink</em>.</h1>

    <h2>What am I looking at?</h2>
    <p>
      A social movement.<br>
      A symbol of resistance.<br> 
      A union for everyone who opposes the current US administration.
    </p>
    <h2>What do I do?</h2>
    <p>
      Wear a pink armband.<br>
      Share a pink armband. <br>
      Spread the word.<br>
      <br>
      Most importantly: <strong>vote in the upcoming midterms.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>That's it?</h2>
    <p>
      Yup. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a simple grassroots movement. No donations, newsletters, or exclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are already plenty<sup><a href="https://www.nokings.org/partners">[1]</a></sup> of organizations<sup><a href="https://www.nilc.org/">[2]</a></sup> doing equally<sup><a href="https://immigrantdefensenetwork.org/">[3]</a></sup> incredible<sup><a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/">[4]</a></sup> things.
      You are encouraged to join them, protest, and exercise your inalienable rights however you can. Take some armbands with you so we can be united in our fight against tyranny.
    </p>
		<h2>I still don't get it</h2>
		<p>
			No one is exempt from tyranny. The beautiful thing about this country (other than our national parks) is that it has been shaped by a diverse group of people.<br><br>
			The purpose of the pink armband is to broadcast a core belief. It is worn so you can recognize who your allies are. There's likely a long list of differences separating you from the person next to you at the grocery store, but by both wearing armbands, you know you both support our country's core principles.

    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    <p>
      Hi. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.<br>
      <br>
      My name is Nathan. I'm a (mostly) regular dude, based in Portland, OR.<br>
      I prefer to keep a low profile and feel weird including this part, but it's my understanding that grassroots movements benefit from leadership, so here I am. I will do my best.<br>
      <br>
      Why am I doing this? I want to help unite people. I want to see activists on the front lines and grandparents at their Sunday service all wearing pink armbands. 
      The hope is that we can unify under a single symbol, through common ground.
    </p>

      It should be obvious to anyone paying attention that what is happening is not okay.

      I'm sure most of us would prefer to live like Hobbits, cozy in our little homes, shielded away from all the bad in the world. I want that for you, too. That's what we are fighting for, right?<br>
      <br>
      Regardless of where you came from, what you look like, how you speak, and so on. This country is <em>supposed</em> to provide and equal opportunity for all.

      Obviously there are countless atrocities happening across the globe that deserve our attention. I hope we can solve those too.
      As much as it pains my altruistic side to say, we need to put our oxygen mask on first before helping others.

      Imagine 

      Hopefully, there will come a time where the armbands can be shelved, packed away, or displayed.
      Maybe future generations will have to take up the pink armband again.

      Why pink? Who's going to take someone spouting "domestic terrorism" seriously about a bunch of people wearing pink?
